    <h1>Git: Merge vs Rebase</h1>

    <h2>Merge</h2>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintains the exact history of changes, showing a visual merge commit where branches converge.</li>
      <li>Easier for beginners as it doesn’t alter commit history.</li>
      <li>Useful in preserving the context of a feature branch, including all individual commits and the merging
        process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can result in a cluttered commit history (merge commits), especially in projects with lots of branches.</li>
      <li>Sometimes harder to track down bugs due to the intertwining histories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Merge is often used in public or open-source projects where it is important to
      preserve the exact history of how features were integrated, or in environments where auditability is crucial.</p>

    <h2>Rebase</h2>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates a cleaner, linear commit history, which can be easier to read and understand when reviewing project
        history.</li>
      <li>Helps in avoiding redundant merge commits.</li>
      <li>Can simplify potential bug hunting as it allows for more straightforward commit bisecting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rewrites commit history, which can be dangerous for shared branches if not used carefully.</li>
      <li>Requires a higher level of Git understanding and discipline, especially in managing conflicts and
        understanding the implications of changing commit history.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Rebase is often preferred in internal teams where maintaining a linear project history
      is more important for the purposes of simplicity and clarity. It’s also useful for updating feature branches with
      the latest from a main or develop branch to ensure smooth integration.</p>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
      a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
      remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
      of Lorem Ipsum.</p>


    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>rebase</strong> for pulling the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch to
        keep it up-to-date.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>merge</strong> when you need to integrate completed features into the main branch to preserve the
        context of the feature development.</li>
    </ul>
