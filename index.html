  <h1>Git: Merge vs Rebase</h1>

  <h2>Merge</h2>
  <h3>Pros:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintains the exact history of changes, showing a visual merge commit where branches converge.</li>
    <li>Easier for beginners as it doesn’t alter commit history.</li>
    <li>Useful in preserving the context of a feature branch, including all individual commits and the merging process.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can result in a cluttered commit history (merge commits), especially in projects with lots of branches.</li>
    <li>Sometimes harder to track down bugs due to the intertwining histories.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Merge is often used in public or open-source projects where it is important to preserve
    the exact history of how features were integrated, or in environments where auditability is crucial.</p>

  <h2>Rebase</h2>
  <h3>Pros:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Creates a cleaner, linear commit history, which can be easier to read and understand when reviewing project
      history.</li>
    <li>Helps in avoiding redundant merge commits.</li>
    <li>Can simplify potential bug hunting as it allows for more straightforward commit bisecting.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Rewrites commit history, which can be dangerous for shared branches if not used carefully.</li>
    <li>Requires a higher level of Git understanding and discipline, especially in managing conflicts and understanding
      the implications of changing commit history.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Rebase is often preferred in internal teams where maintaining a linear project history
    is more important for the purposes of simplicity and clarity. It’s also useful for updating feature branches with
    the latest from a main or develop branch to ensure smooth integration.</p>

  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <strong>rebase</strong> for pulling the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch to keep
      it up-to-date.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>merge</strong> when you need to integrate completed features into the main branch to preserve the
      context of the feature development.</li>
  </ul>
