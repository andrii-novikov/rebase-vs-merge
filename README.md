# Git Guide: Merge vs Rebase
This project serves as an educational tool to illustrate the differences between Git's merge and rebase commands, including their pros, cons, and use cases. It is designed to be a static site served locally using http-server, a simple, zero-configuration command-line HTTP server.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (which includes npm)
- Yarn

## Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-directory
```


2. Install Dependencies Using Yarn, install all required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```


## Usage
To start the server and serve the static files, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start http-server on http://localhost:8000. You can access the web application by navigating to http://localhost:8000/index.html in your web browser.
